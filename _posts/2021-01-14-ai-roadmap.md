Some days ago I've found [this site](https://i.am.ai/roadmap/) which seems to give a good enumeration of the different competences that I'm interested in. Years ago I've completed a [coursera course on machine learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) and the first two parts of the [Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013) but I've never actually used the learnt things in production.

I thought I'd be fun to go over the roadmap and see the gaps in my knowledge.

I know there's always more to learn but I think the LinAlg, Database, Tabular Data, Data Frames, ETL, JSON, XML, CSV and RegExp boxes are ‚úÖ.

I'm not sure what the "Reporting vs BI vs Analytics" box is about. Reporting is a sort of aggregation of past data, business intelligence is the data pipelines/transformations that buys the bread for the company and analytics is detailed measurements in the system to help to refine the system more effectively? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I think I'm good with üêç , `import numpy as np` and `import pandas as pd` is kind of the default first two lines. I like `pipenv` to manage my envs but I may want to take a look at on [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/). I'm also a fan of Jupyter Notebooks.

Data mining is a pretty big topic I guess this box only indicates that you should know something about it. As for the web scraping, I've played with [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) to extract stuff from the web, but that wasn't today either.

I didn't know about the [üï∂ Public Datasets](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets), pretty cool. I'm also on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/balintfodor) but I've never dived deep enough.

The next bunch of boxes ‚úÖ too. Of course, every topic is way more complex then just say "I know all about it" I think I've got a fairly ok understanding of them.
