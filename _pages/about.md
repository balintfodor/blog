I'm a software engineer, usually riding on the c++/cmake/python/git train with a suitcase of 10 years of nicely patterned, tried-to-be-kept-clean code, a backpack of computer vision, appreciating the 3d rendered scenery, heading towards somewhere AI city? With the habit of stopping to see small interesting villages along the way for sipping bad puns coffee at the local Cafe Crappy Metaphors.
