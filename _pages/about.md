I'm a software engineer, usually riding on the c++/cmake/python/git train.

The suitcase holds 10+ years of code, I try to keep them clean so the patterns don't fade. I've got some computer vision, image processing and graphics experience in my backpack as well.

I'm always fascinated with the rendered 3D scenery and ready to have a beer with colleague passengers.

I'm heading somewhere near machine learning city. Occasionally get off to explore interesting villages and to sip bad puns coffee at the local Cafe Crappy Metaphors.
